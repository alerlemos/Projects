## Motivation

Last year, like in many years before, I planned some goals to be achieved in the year that was about to start. One of my goals was to read a certain amount of books, or more precisely, a certain amount of book pages: 5000.

As soon as I started reading, I began to think of projects that I could do to help me keep track of the final goal. First I thought I could fill out an Excel spreadsheet and then load it in Power BI desktop to create some visualizations and gain some insight of what I was reading. 

That was a pretty easy thing to do, considering I buy all my books for my Kindle, and Amazon's web page has all the information I could possible need about them, it was only a matter of copying the information from the book page to the spreadsheet.

Then, I began to think how I could challenge myself and automate this process using only the book's name and language as variables. So, I started learning about Web Scrapping and Web Crawling using Python.
